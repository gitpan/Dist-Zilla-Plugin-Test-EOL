    endings are used

DESCRIPTION
    Generate an author Test::EOL.

    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following files:

ATTRIBUTES
  trailing_whitespace
    If this option is set to a true value, "{ trailing_whitespace => 1 }"
    will be passed to "all_perl_files_ok" in Test::EOL. It defaults to 1.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    This module is a fork of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests and was
    originally written by Florian Ragwitz. It was forked because author the
    Test:: namespace is preferred and because I would prefer to have EOL
    tests be Author tests.
